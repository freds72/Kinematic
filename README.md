EV3 drawing hand application and driver

Project contains:
- quick and dirty Windows App to draw vector lines and text
- EV3 "server" application using MonoBrick SDK
- Robot Hand LEGO Digital Design file
note: the LDD file does not have the "pen up/down" mecanism (yet the software has support for it).
